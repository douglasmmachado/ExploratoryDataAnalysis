# ExploratoryDataAnalysis
Repo for exploratory data analysis for drug consumption in french hospitals


The healthcare sector in France is constantly evolving in a complex and dynamic environment. As hospital centers see their budgets shrinking over the years, they must optimize their resource management while ensuring the safety and quality of care for the patients they serve. Pharmaceutical logistics, which represents a significant portion of hospitals' budget, is an important lever for optimization. This optimization relies on a better understanding of the hospital's medication demand.

In this internship project, we are focusing on predicting the demand (consumption of medications) using machine learning techniques. Previous studies on this subject involved finding the appropriate machine learning model for each medication. In this internship, we are particularly interested in studying the consumption behavior of medications. The objective is to determine if there are medications that exhibit similar consumption behavior. In such cases, it would be more interesting to propose machine learning algorithms to predict the consumption of a group of medications instead of just one.

Approach:
- The first step of this internship is to review the previous work conducted by our doctoral student. These studies will provide an understanding of the context and data of the stud
- In the second step, the intern should conduct a small literature review on clustering methods to identify which method is suitable for our context.
- The third step involves the development and testing of clustering methods on the study's dataset.
- The fourth step is to use prediction methods on the groups obtained from the previous ste
- The final step is to write a scientific report explaining this approach and the results of the last steps.


The notebooks are divided by:

- Exploratory_Data_Analysis: First touch with the database, first insights and analysis;
- Timeseries_Analysis: Exploring the database regarding the consumption of drugs over time;
- Unified_Approach: Using the unified database for the 4 hospitals;
- Division_Approach: Using the divided database for each hospital;
